# Diablo 3 Beta Key Scraper

This bot waits for @BlizzardCS to post a new Diablo 3 beta key and then activates it... before someone else does.

Also, model-based testing fun with rspec.

## Blizzard's Contest

From Monday, April 9 through Friday, April 13 between the hours of 10 a.m. & 7 p.m. PDT, the @BlizzardCS Twitter account will post a series of Diablo III beta keys at random times throughout the week.

Announced here: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4365748549

## Day 1
_Monday April 9_

The key G4JWYY-KPT9-RKGN8T-WY4G-WE24K9 was announced at 11:20am PDT. Our bot detected and posted the key succesfully, but the activation failed - someone else beat us to it.

The bot is running on a Small ec2 instance inside gnu screen. The key is scraped inside an eventmachine twitter-stream loop; the eventmachine then exits and the key is posted to battle.net/account using curl.

### Day 1 Post-mortem
We were too slow. We scraped and posted the key, but someone else beat us to it :(. Let's measure and improve our speed.

### Day 1 Action Items
* record timestamps for key tweet, scrape, and post; the tweet timestamp will be from another clock, but might as well store it
* post the key immediately, instead of stopping eventmachine first
* maintain a logged-in battle.net/account session, instead of logging in, each time, before posting the key
